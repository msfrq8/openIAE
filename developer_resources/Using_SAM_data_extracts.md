### About SAM Data Extracts
SAM Processes **Entity Management** extract files and **Exclusion** extract files for you to download and consume into your local applications. <br>

The Entity Management extract contains information related to a Registration of an Entity including Core Data, Points of Contacts, Representations and Certifications, and other data elements depending on your level of access. <br>

The Exclusions extract contains a list of all currently open exclusions in SAM. This identifies 
entities that are in some way restricted from doing business with the US Federal Government. 

####Extract file processing times:

Monthly extract files are processed on the 1st Sunday of each month. The monthly files contain all active SAM records and SAM records that have become Expired within the last 6 months. 

Daily extract files are processed Tuesday - Saturday of each week. The daily files contain records that have been updated since the last daily file was processed. 


### Where to get SAM Data Extracts 
SAM hosts the extract files on our SFTP server and on the sam.gov site. <br>
1. SFTP - [Click here](https://github.com/GSA/IAE-Architecture/blob/master/as-is/tech-docs/SAM/Guide%20to%20Downloading%20SAM%20Extracts%20via%20SFTP%20Site.pdf?raw=true) for How to Download SAM Extracts from the SFTP server<br>
2. SAM.gov website. Go to [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov/) under the "Data Access" area and you will find all of the extract files. <br>

**SAM Extract files are available at three access levels:**<br>
1. **Public** (includes name, address, Point of Contact information, etc.)<br>
2. For Official Use Only (**FOUO**) (includes certain types of Point of Contact Information and Federal Hierarchy information)<br>
3. **Sensitive** (includes banking information and MPIN)

If you require either **FOUO** or **Sensitive** levels of access you will need to add a role to your SAM account. To do that [click here](https://gsa.github.io/openIAE/developer_resources/Access_SAM_data.html) for instructions.
