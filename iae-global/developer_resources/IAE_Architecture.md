### About the IAE Architecture

The Github GSA IAE Architecrture repository contains all the architecture, design and code artifacts required to 
understand the functional definition of IAE, the design and ultimate technical implementation. It includes everything required to build a production environment for IAE, 
or smaller limited capability environments for the support of development, test or demo activities.
The repository is split into two separate sections. The as-is contains materials related to the pre-transformation systems. 
The to-be contains architecture, design and code for the new transformed environment.
